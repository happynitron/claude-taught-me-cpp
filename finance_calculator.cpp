/* so if i want to save 10k dollars and i can deposit 60 every month. it would take 166.66667 months. so to make the final value an integer, 
, lets consider s as monthly deopsit and g as goal. so we do this ( g/s ) - ((g % s) / s ). which should return an integer. although i think there is a better way to do this
I just dont know how.*/
